# MSUComputerClubWorkshops
Any computer club workshops I have presented will reside here

For Workshop 1 - intro to swiftUI Rock Paper Scissors - I have included the asset catalog of images to import and a workable Rock Paper Scissors App. To add the assets(images) needed for this project I define the 2 methods for xcode and SwiftPlaygrounds on iPad. 
For xcode - drag and drop directly into your assets catalog. 
For swiftPlaygrounds - download the repository and add them individually to the app you make
